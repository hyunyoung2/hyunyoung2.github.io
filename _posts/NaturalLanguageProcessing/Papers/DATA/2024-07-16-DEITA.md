This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [What Makse Good Data for Alignment? A Comprehensive Study of Automatic Data Selection in Instruction Tuning (Liu et al., ICLR 2024)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BTKAeLqLMw), that I read and studied. 

{% include MathJax.html %}

They focus on the data quality for alignment, so they make the standard which is selected for good data.

Three dimensions is included 
 - Complexity
 - Quality
 - Diversity
