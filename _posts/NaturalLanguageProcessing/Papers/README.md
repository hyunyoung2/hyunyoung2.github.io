# Papers

In this section, I will continously arrange stuffs, when I read and study materials such as paper, tutorial, and lecture etc.

The research of interest moslty focuse on NLP (natural language processing) like QA (Questions Answering), dialogue, embedding, Language modeling ect. based on deeplearning and neural network, 
but in this section I would broadly deal with scopes like information retrieval and recommendation etc.
