This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [Qwen-VL: A Versatile Vision-Language Model for Understanding, Localization, Text Reading, and Beyond (Bai et al. arXiv 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12966), that I read and studied.

For detailed experiment and explanation, refer to the paper, titled [Qwen-VL: A Versatile Vision-Language Model for Understanding, Localization, Text Reading, and Beyond (Bai et al. arXiv 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12966)

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note(Abstract): </b>
In this work, we introduce the Qwen-VL series, a set of large-scale vision-language models (LVLMs) designed to perceive and understand both texts and images. Starting from the Qwen-LM as a foundation, we endow it with visual capacity by the meticulously designed (i) visual receptor, (ii) input-output interface, (iii) 3-stage training pipeline, and (iv) multilingual multimodal cleaned corpus. Beyond the conventional image description and question-answering, we implement the grounding and text-reading ability of Qwen-VLs by aligning image-caption-box tuples. The resulting models, including Qwen-VL and Qwen-VL-Chat, set new records for generalist models under similar model scales on a broad range of visual-centric benchmarks (e.g., image captioning, question answering, visual grounding) and different settings (e.g., zero-shot, few-shot). Moreover, on real-world dialog benchmarks, our instruction-tuned Qwen-VL-Chat also demonstrates superiority compared to existing vision-language chatbots. Code, demo and models are available at this [https URL](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-VL).
