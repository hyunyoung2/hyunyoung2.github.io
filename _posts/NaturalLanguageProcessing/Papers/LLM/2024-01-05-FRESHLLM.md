This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [FRESHLLMs: Refreshing Large Language Models with Search Engine Augmentation (vu et al., arXiv 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03214), that I read and studied.
