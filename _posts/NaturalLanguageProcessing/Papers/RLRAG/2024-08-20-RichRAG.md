This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [RichRAG: Crafting Rich Reponses for Multi-faceted Queries in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Wang et al., arXiv 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12566), that I read and studied.

They proposed the RAG,called RichRAG, for rich and comprehensive response. 

The RichRAG consists of sub-aspect explorer, the multi-faceted retriever, and the generative list-wise ranker.
