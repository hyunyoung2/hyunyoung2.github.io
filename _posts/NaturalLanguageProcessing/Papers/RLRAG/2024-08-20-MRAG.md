This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [M-RAG: Reinforcing Large Language Model Perforemance through Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Multiple Partitions (Wang et al., ACL 2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.108/), that I read and studied. 

{% include MathJax.html %}


They peform RAG with mutiple partitions in a database system.

For detailed experiment and explanation, refer to the paper, titled [M-RAG: Reinforcing Large Language Model Perforemance through Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Multiple Partitions (Wang et al., ACL 2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.108/)
