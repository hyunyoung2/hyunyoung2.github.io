This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper titled [ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT. Khattab et al., arXiv 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12832) that I read and studied.

They propose effective ranking models based on Language model, Rather the ranking models based on Language model increase the computation cost, in particular, as they muse deal with each query-document pair to obtain relevance score. 

To address this, they present ColBERT, which is a novel ranking model that adapts deep Langague models for effective retrieval.

ColBERT introduces a **late interaction architecture** that independently encodes the query and the document with BERT to attain fine-grained similarity from the intreaction between query and document
