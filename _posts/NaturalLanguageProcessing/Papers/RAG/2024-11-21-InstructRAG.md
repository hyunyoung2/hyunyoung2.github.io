This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [InstructRAG - Instructing Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Self-Synthesized Rationales (Wei et al., arXiv 2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13629), that I read and studied. 

{% include MathJax.html %}

They were saying that imperfect retrievers or noisy corpora can introduce misleading or even erroneous information to the retrieved contents, so it downgrades generation quality.

For detailed experiment and explanation, refer to the paper, titled [InstructRAG - Instructing Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Self-Synthesized Rationales (Wei et al., arXiv 2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13629)
