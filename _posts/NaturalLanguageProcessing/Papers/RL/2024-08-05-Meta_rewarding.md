This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [Meta-Rewarding Language Models: Self-Improving Alignment with LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge (Wu et al., arXiv 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19594), that I read and studied.
