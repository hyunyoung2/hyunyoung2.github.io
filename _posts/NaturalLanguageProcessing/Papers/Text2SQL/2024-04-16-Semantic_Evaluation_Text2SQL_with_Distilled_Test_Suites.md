This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [Semantic Evaluation for Text-to-SQL with Distilled Test Suites (Zhong et al., EMNLP 2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.29/), that I read and studied.
