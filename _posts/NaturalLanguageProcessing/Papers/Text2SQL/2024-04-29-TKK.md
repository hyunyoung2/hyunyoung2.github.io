This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [Towards Generalizable and Robust Text-to-SQL Parsing (Gao et al., EMNLP 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.155/), that I read and studied. 

{% include MathJax.html %}

They proposed that Text-to-SQL parser should be built with strong generalizability in terms of all three levels of generalization, namely i.i.d., zero-shot, and compositional, and robustness again input perturbations.

So, they propose a novel framework consisting of three learning stages including **T**ask decomposition, **K**nowledge acquisition, and **K**nowledge composition (TKK)
