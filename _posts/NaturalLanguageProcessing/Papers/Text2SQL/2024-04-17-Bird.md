This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [Can LLM Already Serve as A Database Interface? A BIg Bench for Large-Scale Database Grounded Text-to-SQLs (Li et al., NeurIPS 2023)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dI4wzAE6uV), that I read and studied. 

{% include MathJax.html %}

They proposed the new type of dataset which is called BIRD (i.e. a **BI**g bench for la**R**ge-scale Database grounded in text-to-SQL task).

They said the existing dataset, i.e., WikiSQL and Spider, focus on database schema with few rows of database values leaving the gap between academic study and real-world applicationm. To reduce the gap, they present BIRD benchmark.

From the benchmark, they imply external knowledge grounding problem in Text2SQL task.
