This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [A survey on Text-to-SQL Parsing: Concepts, Methods, and Future Directions (Qin et al., arXiv 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13629), that I read and studied.

Recently, the generative model in deep learning have significantly advanced the text2SQL task regarding LLM as estimation mapping function from natural language question to an output SQL query.

This paper provides a comprehensive review on deep learning approaches for text-to-SQL parsing.

This paper presented Three points such 1) Whether Dataset such Text-to-SQL copora is single-turn or multi-turn, 2) pre-trained language model and existing method for text-to-SQL parsing, 3) future and potential challenges for text-to-SQL Parsing.
