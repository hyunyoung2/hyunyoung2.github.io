This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [Spider: A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL Task (Yu et al., EMNLP 2018)](https://aclanthology.org/D18-1425/), that I read and studied.
