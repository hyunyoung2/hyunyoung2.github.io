This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [Spider: A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL Task (Yu et al., EMNLP 2018)](https://aclanthology.org/D18-1425/), that I read and studied.

They proposed new dataset for Text2SQL task complementing the shortcomings of the conventional Text2SQL dataset. 

 - First, SQL query split where no SQL query is allowed to appear in more that one set among the train, dev, and test set.
 - Second, The hardness of SQL is separate into the detailed items such as **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**, **Extra Hard** for complex SQL rather than the existing simple version like WikiSQL.
 - Third, The number of tables in dataset is more than one table to resolve the generalization to new domain for Text2SQL.
