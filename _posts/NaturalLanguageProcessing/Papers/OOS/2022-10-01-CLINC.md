This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [An Evaluation Dataset for Intent Classification and Out-of-Scope Prediction (Larson et al. EMNLP 2019)](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1131/), that I read and studied. 

They release new dataset for out-of-scope intent classification.

The dataset is CLINC which can look into [CLINC github](https://github.com/clinc/oos-eval).

I would summarize what I study on the paper, titled [An Evaluation Dataset for Intent Classification and Out-of-Scope Prediction (Larson et al. EMNLP 2019)](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1131/)
