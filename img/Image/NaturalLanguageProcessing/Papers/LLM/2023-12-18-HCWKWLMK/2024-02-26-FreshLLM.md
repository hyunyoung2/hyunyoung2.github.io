This post is a brief summary about the paper that I read for my study and curiosity, so I shortly arrange the content of the paper, titled [FreshLLMs: Refreshing Larage Language Models with Search Engine Augmentation (Vu et al., arXiv 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03214)
, that I read and studied.
